# Analyzing a Climbing Logbook



### Motivation and Background

As an avid climber, common questions we all have are:  
How does my height/weight/age affect how hard I can climb?  
Is this different for routes vs boulders?  
How long will it take me to progress to a certain level?  
Is this route/boulder graded correctly?

Left: V4, Right: Also V4??

As such, I've set out to see if I can answer some of these questions using data from climbers.

I have two ultimate goals:
1. Find a model that predicts which grade a route/boulder should have.
2. Find a model that predicts how hard a climber will climb in the next year.

### Datasource

This data comes from the site 8a.nu, where climbers can keep a log of which boulders and routes they have completed and when. This data was downloaded from Kaggle, courtesy of David Cohen.
